### Notes:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses an alpha version of React in order to use the "hooks" feature.

This project uses tailwindcss (functional css) to build the UI.

`yarn` 

`yarn dev` 

to start the app on dev mode.

On the route "/admin" there is an admin area to add bikes, customizables and check orders.

### Important: 
the dev version of this project will only be fully functional if there is a version of the backend running locally too (https://github.com/eldiegod/bike-shop-backend)
